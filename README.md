This project involves learning how to use Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) a Natural Language Processing technique in the context of teaching the model how to classify recipes from different cuisines. This project uses PyTorch to build a CBOW model which learns the ingredient embeddings for the dataset. This model is the compared to the statistical technique Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to compare performances.

As can be seen the plot using the CBOW model shows significantly better separation than that of the PCA model. 

The final CBOW model achieves a 75% classification accuracy on the dataset
